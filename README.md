Project 1 - Homework 1.

Each Student must demonstrate the ability to set up a folder properly and include the necessary Javascript file.
The secondary focus of this assignment is typography on the web. Students will be given copy and a few images (related to 
the midterm) to work with. The goal is to prepare students for the midterm project by thinking about how they may handle 
typography in their project.
Each student is responsible for selecting appropriate fonts (using the techniques covered in class e.g. google fonts or CSS3 
@font-face) and CSS styles to enhance the copy. Line Height, Letter Spacing, Font Weight, Colour and Type are the critical 
components of this assignment.
The text will be placed on a single provided web page (CSS Grid) with no other design elements other than the text and images 
provided.
